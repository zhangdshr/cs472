<p><strong>1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
    x = 1;
    var a = 5;
    var b = 10;
    var c = function(a, b, c) {
    var x = 10;
    document.write(x);
    document.write(a);
    var f = function(a, b, c) {
    b = a;
    document.write(b);
    b = c;
    var x = 5;
    }
    f(a,b,c);
    document.write(b);
    }
    c(8,9,10);
    document.write(b);
    document.write(x);
    }</strong><br>10,8,8,9,10,1</p>
<p><strong>2. What is the difference between a method and function?</strong><br>A function is defined outside of an
    object.
    A method is defined as the property of an object.In addition, methods are implicitly given a reference to the parent
    object (this) and are able to operate on other data that is stored within the object.</p>
<p><strong>3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?</strong><br>The current class.</p>
<p><strong>4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?</strong><br>The current object.</p>
<p><strong>5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?</strong><br>The newly created
    object.</p>
<p><strong>6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword
    'this'.
    When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?
</strong><br>x</p>
<p><strong>7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?</strong><br>A variable referred to by a function that is
    not one of its parameters or local variables.</p>
<p><strong>8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a
    function
    that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.</strong><br>
