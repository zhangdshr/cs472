<div><p><strong>1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?<br>
    setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
    setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);</strong> <br>
    setTimeout(booyah(), 2000) calls the function immediately, setTimeout(booyah, 2000) wait the 2000ms.
</p>
    <p><strong>2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?<br>
        var myfunc = function(a, x) {
        return a * x;
        };
        var x = myfunc(2, 3);
        var y = myfunc;
        alert(x);
        alert(y(2,3)); </strong> <br>It will display 2 alert popup boxes, each with number 6.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds
        that
        says “BOOYAH!”<br>
        setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
        setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);
    </strong> <br>
        function booyah1() {
        alert("BOOYAH!");}<br><br>
        function booyah2() {
        setTimeout(alert("BOOYAH!"),2000);}
    </p>
    <p><strong>4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the
        reasons
        for using it)?</strong> <br>
        It means the separation of content (HTML) presentation(CSS) and behavior (Javascript).<br>
        In the lecture slide code, we attach event handlers to elements' DOM objects in the JavaScript code, instead of
        HTML is cluttered with JS code.<br>
        Usability: An unobtrusive DOM script does not draw the attention of the user - visitors use it without thinking
        about it.
        Graceful degradation: Unobtrusive DOM scripts never generate error messages, in any browser, even when they
        fail. If features cannot be presented properly, they silently disappear.
        Accessibility: If any script fails, the page still delivers its core functions and information via the markup,
        stylesheets and/or server-side scripting.
        Separation: For the benefit of other and future web developers, all JavaScript code is maintained separately,
        without impacting other files of script, markup or code.
